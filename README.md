## New Telegraph iOS app

Test application for The Telegraph group

#### Installation

* git clone git@github.com:rafiki270/NewTelegraph.git
* build and run the project

Optionally you can ```pod install``` to update pods

#### Third party libraries used

* Alamofire - Swift successor of AFNetworking, great handling of url requests
* SnapKit - Swift version of Masonry, simplifies working with autolayout constraints in code
* SwiftJSON - Better handling of parsed JSON data than the native solution
* SwiftSpinner - Preloading indicator, custom implementation wasnâ€™t necessary as there were no design guidelines, also, model is easily processed by the library. This library I would be very cautious to use in production as I usually like to work with custom designs for the whole app

#### Notes

* On a number of places, code contains todo notes in a format ``` // TODO: Message``` to describe functionality that would be a nice to have in a production and not a test environment
* Interface for both iPhone and iPad works only in portrait mode. To make this a full featured app, I would use size classes to pass arguments to the flow layout and the view controller handling cells to resize for selected devices accordingly
* Only example of some unit and UI tests are implemented to present my ability to work in TDD & BDD environment. Also, in a TDD environment all required tests would be always completed before the actual code is written. BasicViewController has complete tests on everything I could have think of, MovieListViewController has some other example tests
* I haven't found a good swift replacement for OCMock yet so mocks are done manually for now
* There is one warning generated by the Alamofire that I was unable to silence from the Podfile and didn't have time to deal with more

#### To be noticed
* Lang.swift encapsulates localization settings to allow for easy language development in the future without having the trouble of finding all trings later (just a good practice I guess)
* Accesibility has been enabled and tested


#### Thank you
